        'grid-auto-row' and 'grid-auto-column' are properties in CSS Grid layout that control the sizing and behaviour of implicitly created rows and columns when grid items are placed outside of explicitly defined grid tracks.
          In this example, the '.grid-container' has two explicitly defined columns and rows, each with a size of 100px by 50px. If additional grid items are added beyond the explicitly defined grid, they will create implicit rows and columns 
     With the given CSS, if there are more than two items in a row, new rows will be created implicitly. Each implicitly created row will have a height of 75px, and each implicitly created column will have a width of 75px, as defined by 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns', respectively
